# Abstractive-Text-Summarization
BERT and BART Fusion Model for Abstractive Text Summarization
ðŸ“‹ Overview
This project implements an abstractive text summarization system combining the strengths of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers). The system aims to generate concise, meaningful summaries for English text inputs by leveraging BERT for contextual embeddings and BART for sequence-to-sequence transformation.

ðŸ§  Features
Generates high-quality abstractive summaries of English text.
Combines pre-trained BERT embeddings with BARTâ€™s generative capabilities.
Suitable for summarizing articles, reports, and other text documents.
Configurable hyperparameters for training and inference.
